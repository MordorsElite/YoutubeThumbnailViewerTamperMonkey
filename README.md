## Disclaimer

This script was vibe-coded using various AI-models. I have made sure the resulting script works reliably (as of 2025-12-06) and that it doesn't do anything it should not.
The code itself might not be particularly optimized, but my goal in making this script was simply to get the functionality I wanted.

The is no tracking, data collection or anything of the sort from my end.
